        <img class="Abbey" src="../lesson12/images/abbeyocala.jpg" alt="image of Abbey">
        <p>Abbey is a small dental office in downtown Ocala. She works with a lot of people in the community and lots of business in the medial and health field in the Ocala area.
            While practicing in a large city does have benefits, there are drawbacks. There is more competition, much more. 
            New dentists in Urban areas often offer extended hours including Saturdays just to be competitive. The cost of living is expensive, as is practice overhead. 
            As a young dentist Abbey doesn't feel pressure to participate in plans as long as they know their competition participates. 
            With our group she can help her small dental business stay strong and help her to grow and give back.</p>
